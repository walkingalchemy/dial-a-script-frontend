> A tool for creating, dialing and sharing call scripts

Dial-A-Script is a web based tool for writing, calling and sharing call scripts.  This is the repository for the [React]((https://reactjs.org/)) based frontend.  The backend api repository resides at: [Dial-A-Script-Backend](https://github.com/walkingalchemy/Dial-A-Script-Backend)

## Installing / Getting started


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [react](https://reactjs.org/).  It also uses [react-redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux) and [react-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed. 

Begin by installing and running the backend API server [Dial-A-Script-Backend](https://github.com/walkingalchemy/Dial-A-Script-Backend).

Then in a separate directory:
Fork and/or clone the repository down then run:

```shell
npm install
```

to get dependencies installed locally.
Then
```shell
npm start
```
to get it serving to your local host.  If you are running your API server on localhost:3000 you will be asked if you would like to start the client server on a different port.  Press Y and enter to allow this.
Because it is a Create-React app this will automatically open a browser window pointing to the frontend and you will be able to interact from there.
